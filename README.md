* Resize large images to the size needed by your design.
* Generate multiple smaller images to make sure devices download the optimal-sized one.
* Automatically compress and optimize your image with the powerful Filestack API.
* Efficiently lazy load images to speed initial page load and save bandwidth.
* Use the "blur-up" technique or solid background color to show a preview of the image while it loads.
* Hold the image position so your page doesn't jump while images load.

## Quickstart

Here's an example using a static asset object.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Image from "@graphcms/react-image";

const IndexPage = () => {
  const asset = {
    handle: "uQrLj1QRWKJnlQv1sEmC",
    width: 800,
    height: 800
  }
  
  return <Image image={asset} maxWidth={800} />
}
```

## Install

```bash
npm install @graphcms/react-image
```

## Props

| Name                    | Type                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `image`                 | `object`                         | An object of shape `{ handle, width, height }`. Handle is an identifier required to display the image and both `width` and                                                      `height` are required to display a correct placeholder and aspect ratio for the image. You can get all 3 by just putting all 3 in your image-getting query. |
| `maxWidth`              | `number`                         | Maximum width you'd like your image to take up. (ex. If your image container is resizing dynamically up to a width of 1200, put it as a `maxWidth`)                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `fadeIn`                | `bool`                           | Do you want your image to fade in on load? Defaults to `true`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `fit`                   | `"clip"\|"crop"\|"scale"\|"max"` | When resizing the image, how would you like it to fit the new dimensions? Defaults to `crop`. You can read more about resizing [here](https://www.filestack.com/docs/api/processing/#resize)                                                                                                                                          |
| `withWebp`              | `bool`                           | If webp is supported by the browser, the images will be served with `.webp` extension. (Recommended)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
